# Just for Fun with HTML and CSS

Welcome to my project! I'm currently experimenting with HTML and CSS to create something awesome. Later, I'll be adding JavaScript to make it even more interactive!

## About This Project

This project is a playground for me to explore different HTML and CSS techniques, experiment with layouts, styles, and animations. It's all about creativity, learning, and having fun!

## Plans for the Future

While this project is currently focused on HTML and CSS, I have plans to incorporate JavaScript to add dynamic functionality and interactivity. Stay tuned for updates as I continue to develop and improve this project!
